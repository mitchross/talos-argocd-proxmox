# Longhorn Node Failure and Recovery Settings
# These settings prevent the issues you experienced with faulted volumes
# when nodes were removed from the cluster.

---
# CRITICAL: Automatically delete pods when a node goes down
# This allows Longhorn to reschedule replicas to healthy nodes
# Current: do-nothing (causes volumes to stay faulted)
# Options: do-nothing, delete-deployment-pod, delete-statefulset-pod, delete-both-statefulset-and-deployment-pod
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: node-down-pod-deletion-policy
  namespace: longhorn-system
value: "delete-both-statefulset-and-deployment-pod"

---
# Automatically delete orphaned data when all replicas are lost
# This prevents PVCs from getting stuck in Terminating state
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: orphan-auto-deletion
  namespace: longhorn-system
value: "true"

---
# Block node drain if it contains the last healthy replica
# This prevents accidental data loss when draining nodes
# Current: already set to block-if-contains-last-replica ✓
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: Setting
metadata:
  name: node-drain-policy
  namespace: longhorn-system
value: "block-if-contains-last-replica"

---
# Increase storage reserved percentage to prevent "insufficient storage" errors
# Current: 10% - This was too low and caused your volume creation failures
# Recommended: 25% for production
apiVersion: longhorn.io/v1beta2
kind: Setting

# Enable fast replica rebuild for quicker recovery

kind: Setting

# Allow concurrent replica rebuilds per node
# Helps recover faster when multiple volumes are affected
# Current: 5 (good default)

kind: Setting

# Disable scheduling on cordoned nodes
# Prevents new replicas from being placed on nodes being drained

kind: Setting

# Automatically detach volumes on node failure after timeout
# This allows volumes to be reattached to healthy nodes
