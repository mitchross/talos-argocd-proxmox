# Craft Anything: evidence-first investigation

Use Craft Anything when an answer depends on something that was *built and shipped*: an executable, a
library, an app bundle, an APK, an Electron app, a WebAssembly module, firmware, a crash dump or a
network capture. If you have the source code and the question is about the source, read the source
instead; that is faster and more direct.

## Connect only when you need it

- If the `craft-anything` tools are already in your tool list, go straight to work. Don't run setup or
  doctor first.
- Trust the live tool list and its schemas over this file; the server may be newer or older.
- If the tools are missing or failing to start, run `craft-anything-cli doctor` and then
  `craft-anything-cli setup --dry-run` and show the user the plan before applying anything. After a
  successful setup the user must restart or reconnect their app.
- Only a small core toolset is listed at first. Call `list_toolsets` to see the others and
  `enable_toolset` to switch one on (native code, Android, Apple, web, runtime…).
- In Clean room (Deep mode off, the default) nothing inside a target is read: only the tools that
  work from outside are listed, and others are refused with `details.reason` `clean_room`. Tell the
  user the question needs Deep mode (the switch in the app, `settings_set deep_mode true`, or the
  server started with `--deep`) instead of working around it.

## Working memory: keep it current

Long investigations outlive any single context window. The project keeps a brief, plan, hypotheses,
findings and a handoff note; use them every time.

1. **Start or resume.** Call `core_investigation_show` first. If there is a handoff, continue from it and
   the plan instead of starting over. Also call `core_session_show` to see what is open.
2. **New question?** Before any analysis call, write the brief with `core_brief_write` (the question, why
   it's being asked, the targets, constraints such as "don't run the program", and what a finished
   answer looks like) and an initial plan with `core_plan_update` (short numbered steps, each
   `todo`/`doing`/`done`/`blocked` with a reason).
3. **After each batch of tool calls:** update the plan's step status. When you form a claim worth
   testing, `core_hypothesis_record` with the prediction that would confirm or refute it. When evidence
   arrives, `core_hypothesis_update` (supported, refuted, abandoned) and attach the evidence ids.
4. **When something is settled:** `core_finding_record` with the statement and at least one evidence id.
   Findings are what reports are built from, never chat text.
5. **At the end of every turn:** `core_handoff_write`: where things stand, what to do next, and traps to
   avoid (dead ends, slow tools, misleading strings). Write it as if a stranger picks this up next.
6. `core_journal_read` shows every earlier tool call and model turn when you need to know what was
   already tried.

## Method

- **Observe, derive, infer, and say which.** Observed facts come straight from the bytes or a
  capture. Derived facts are computed from observations (a control-flow graph, a call graph).
  Inferences are judgment (names, intent, a model's reading). Label each claim accordingly.
- **Cite evidence ids** (`ev_…`) for every claim. A claim with no evidence id is a hypothesis.
- **Absence is not proof.** "No string found" or "no caller found" only covers what was searched.
  State the search boundary and the coverage the tool reported, and record an unknown
  (`core_unknown_add`) for anything that matters but is still open.
- **Predict, then verify.** Before running a tool to test a hypothesis, write down what you expect to
  see. If the result disagrees, update the hypothesis instead of explaining the result away.
- **Summary first, then page.** Large results come back as a summary plus an evidence id. Ask for
  pages (`offset`/`limit`) or the specific item you need instead of everything at once. Never repeat
  an identical call that already succeeded or was rejected.
- **Format-aware, not filename-aware.** Let the parsers tell you what a file is.

## Where to start, by target

| Target | First step |
|---|---|
| Native executable or library (ELF, PE, Mach-O) | `core_target_open`, then the overview, search and function tools |
| Electron app, `.asar`, or a JavaScript bundle | `core_target_open` on the app or archive, then the JavaScript toolset |
| Android APK / DEX | `core_target_open`, then the Android toolset |
| .NET assembly | `core_target_open`, then the managed toolset |
| WebAssembly, Go, PE resources, firmware, crash dumps | the formats toolset |
| A live web page or Electron window | the browser toolset (observation only) |
| Two versions of the same app | open both, then the application toolset's comparison tools |

If the user says "my app" without naming it, ask which one. Never guess with an example file.

## Consent and safety

- Tools that run the target's code or change a connected device need the user's explicit OK. If a
  call returns `consent_required`, explain what it would do and ask; never look for a way around it.
- Static analysis never runs the target. Don't claim runtime behaviour from static evidence alone;
  say it is inferred.
- Never put secrets, cookies or personal data into notes, findings or handoffs.

## When something fails

| Error code | What to do |
|---|---|
| `not_found` | Open a target first (`core_target_open`), or check the path or name |
| `feature_missing` / `engine_missing` | Read the remediation; it names the toolset, engine or setting needed |
| `over_limit` | The result was too big to send; page it or read it by evidence id (`evidence://<id>` resource) |
| `stale_revision` | Re-read with `core_investigation_show`, merge, retry |
| `consent_required` | Ask the user |

Before you finish: mark each plan step done or blocked, make sure every conclusion in your answer
matches a recorded finding, list what is still unknown, and write the handoff.
